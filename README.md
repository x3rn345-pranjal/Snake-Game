<h1>CS Project | Shuffle Game
</h1>

Project Motivation: This is my first project in the core computer science. The motivation for doing this project was primarily an interest in undertaking a challenging project. These were the
things that were not taught much during the lecture and this made things more challenging for us. The only thought
that kept us going was that the game after completion would look awesome. This brain Game would really brainstorm
your mind. The project uses the library Graphics.h , exploring which gave us insights into some really basic functions of Graphics, knowledge of which would help us to explore modern graphic libraries with their backgroud exhaustively. I also extend my gratitude towards <b>Dr. Tanima Dutta Mam</b> and <b>Nikhil Tripathi Sir</b> for helping me out in this project.

<h2>About the Game</h2>

left out blank(empty space for moving the tiles) . All you have to do is to bring all the numbers at their respective
indexes .
